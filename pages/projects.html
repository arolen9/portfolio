                    <li>Deployed multiple VMs (Kali, Metasploitable) using <span class="tag">VMware</span>.</li>
                    <li>Configured a segmented network with a <span class="tag">pfSense</span> firewall for traffic control and logging.</li>
                    <li>Aggregated logs to a centralized <span class="tag">Splunk</span> instance for monitoring.</li>
                    <li>Simulated attacks (port scans, web exploits) using <span class="tag">Metasploit</span> from a Kali attacker VM.</li>
                    <li>Developed correlation searches and dashboards in Splunk to detect malicious activity based on the <span class="tag">MITRE ATT&CK</span> framework.</li>
